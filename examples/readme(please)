I suggest you check out and compile the entire follow_the_leader package instead of checking out this subdirectory

	/navigationstack:
-Before running, please change:
  -gds.world: line 65 to your correct filepath for gds2.pgm
  -move_base.xml: all 'rosparam' filepaths need to be similarly corrected
  -gds_move_base.launch:
	-filepaths in lines 4,6,9,10. Maybe line 5 if you did not check out the whole follow_the_leader package
-to run:
  -roslaunch gds_move_base.launch
  -in RViz, select '2D Nav Goal' or press 'g'. Hold down left-click on a goal point in the map, and move your mouse
	to your desired yaw. Then release to set that goal pose

	/my_controller:
-if you checked out follow_the_leader, it should work out-of-the-box. otherwise amend filepaths in lines 6, 9
-to run: roslaunch controller_test.launch.
  -Select points like previously described in RViz. This controller is designed to work with many points 
	in a sort of 'path'. RViz will draw the path of points you select with your mouse, but the first point will not be shown
	until the second point has been put down.
